				    <p>I'm happy to share that PayPoint has included me in the “meet the team” section of their careers page on their corporate website. This is a great opportunity for me to share my experience working at PayPoint.</p>
				    
					<p><a href="https://corporate.paypoint.com/our-proposition/model" target="_blank">PayPoint PLC</a> is a FTSE 250 company from the UK that provides services to convenience stores, online merchants and consumers. These services include Payment & Banking, Parcels, and Retail Services.</p>

					<p>You can read about my experience on the <a href="https://corporate.paypoint.com/careers/meet" target="_blank">website</a>, but I have also shared my experience below.</p>

					<h3 class="mt-4 mb-2">How long have you been working at PayPoint and what role do you do?</h3>
					<p>I am a Data Analyst in the Data Analytics Team, situated in Finance. My journey at PayPoint started with a Data Analyst internship in 2018, where I quickly progressed into a permanent position as a Junior Data Analyst. I continued to gain experience and develop in my role, being promoted to Data Analyst. The role requires exploring, transforming, analysing, and presenting data to deliver insights and recommendations for various domains within the business. There are excellent opportunities to work on end-to-end solutions throughout the data pipeline. My day-to-day duties include engaging with stakeholders, data modelling, and developing reports.</p>
					
					<h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">What advice would you give someone keen to get into a Data Analyst role?</h3>
					<p>Staying up to date with the latest technology will always help with your future prospects. At PayPoint, we use tools and languages including (but not limited to) Power BI, Python, SQL, and DAX. Knowledge of data modelling is also essential for understanding how data is related, and for creating your own data models for analysis. These are great to learn for anyone looking to get into a data analysis role. Funded through PayPoint’s apprenticeship program, I obtained a master’s in data science from The University of Exeter. I also have a bachelor’s degree in computer science from the University of Kent.</p>
					
					<h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">What are the best bits about working at PayPoint?</h3>
					<p>The people are great! It’s an enjoyable place to work as everyone is friendly. The ability to work from home also makes it a flexible place to work. The direction of the company is very strong, with a positive feel all around. You always get the opportunity to learn new things which you can apply to your role. We get some great benefits too, including an on-site gym which is convenient to use.</p> -->
